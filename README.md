# Data Preparation

## Overview
This section summarizes the process of initial exploration and cleaning of the data from a UK-based online retailer.  The data are used in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/market-basket-prepare/) to discover co-occurrence relationships among customersâ€™ purchase activities, such as the likelihood to purchase a candle holder if the customer already has candles and matches in their shopping cart. Such an analysis is called market basket analysis or association analysis.  It is commonly used in marketing to increase the chance of cross-selling, provide recommendations to customers (e.g., based on their browsing history) and deliver targeted marketing (e.g., offer coupons to customers for products that are frequently purchased together with items that the customers recently bought).

The market basket analysis is discussed in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/market-basket-prepare/).

The analysis for this project was performed in R.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

We start by generating a few features that we will use in subsequent analysis.  These features inlude the date and time of the invoice, the total amount spent equal to the product of the item's price and quantity purchased, and an ID variable identifying all purchases by a customer on a particular day:

```R
items$Date = as.Date(items$InvoiceDate, "%m/%d/%y")               # create date variable from InvoiceDate, which also includes time
items$DateTime = strptime(items$InvoiceDate, format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
items$Hour = as.numeric(substr(items$DateTime, 12, 13))           # create hour variable
items$Minute = as.numeric(substr(items$DateTime, 15, 16))         # create hour variable
items$HourMinute = items$Hour + items$Minute / 60
items$ID = paste(as.character(items$CustomerID), as.character(items$Date))   # new id variable based on (customer id, date) group
items$AmountSpent = items$Quantity * items$UnitPrice
items$InvoiceDate = NULL
```

With all the features in place, let's take a look at the summary statistics generated by the code below

```R
dim(items)                    # dimensions
summary(items)                # summary stats
apply(is.na(items), 2, sum)   # missing values
```

The summary statistics below show that the dataset has 541,909 samples and 14 features.  The customers reside predominantly in the UK, make approximately 50% of their purchases between 11:45am and 3:30pm (see HourMinute feature) and buy the median quantity of 3 units per item at the median price of 2.08 pounds per unit. We note and discuss further below that an invoice may include multiple items.

The summary statistics also show several patterns in the data that need to be addressed further.  Specifically, 135,080 CustomerIDs are missing, which is approximately 25% of the dataset.  Further, there are items with negative quantities (returns) and negative prices (see Panel A); mismatches between StockCode and Description counts (see Panel B), while the small magnitudes of mismatches in some instances (e.g., 2203 items for StockCode 22423 versus 2200 items for REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER) and exact matches in other instances (e.g., 2159 items for StockCode 85099B versus the same number of items for JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT) suggest that StockCode and Description counts should match.

Futher look at the data reveals that apart from the irregularities observed from the summary statistics table above, there are a number of missing or invalid descriptions, such as "?display?", "?missing", "??", "historic computer difference?....se", "POSSIBLE DAMAGES OR LOST?", etc. Also, the highest prices in the data appear against such Description fields as "AMAZON FEE", "Adjust bad debt", "POSTAGE", "DOTCOM POSTAGE", "Manual", i.e., desctiptions of various actions rather than names of items.  Finally, there are a number of cancellations that can be identified using letter "C" in the beginning of InvoiceNo.

Invalid samples should be removed from the data before we run the algorithm to determine associations between customer purchases.  We will deal with these samples first and look into how to handle missing CustomerIDs after that.

Let's check out mismatches between StockCode and Description.  Let's take a look, for example, at StockCode 22423, which has 2,203 instances versus 2,200 instances of "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER" (a difference of 3 instances).

```R
temp = items[items$StockCode == 22423,]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER",]
```

The code above generates the follwoing output:

```

```

It appears that the 3 items that result in the mismatch represent returns (negative Quantity for each) due to "damages" for two of the items and "faulty" for the third item.  Once we get rid of returned items, this mismatch then will be resolved.

The same issue appears to affect StockCode 84879 (1 mismatch as compared to the Description field):

```R
temp = items[items$StockCode == 84879,]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "ASSORTED COLOUR BIRD ORNAMENT",]
```

The code above generates the follwoing output:

```

```

We can see that the mismatch resulted from one damaged item that has been returned.

Let's now remove the returned items from the data.  From looking further at the data it also appears that there are a number of items with zero quantity.  Let's get rid of these observations as well:

```R
nrow(items[items$Quantity <= 0,])   
items = items[items$Quantity > 0,]
nrow(items)
```

The above code removed `10624` samples, thus reducing the total number of samples from `541909` to `531285`.

Now let's look at the remaining mismatches, i.e., StockCodes 85123A (56 mismatches) and 20725 (1 mismatch).  The code below identifies the reasons for the mismatches and resolve some of the mismatches:  

```R
temp = items[items$Description == "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER",]
unique(temp$StockCode)
items$StockCode[items$StockCode == "85123a"] = "85123A"
unique(items$Description[items$StockCode == "85123A"])
items[items$Description == "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER",]

temp = items[items$StockCode == "20725",]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "LUNCH BAG RED RETROSPOT",]
items[items$Description == "LUNCH BAG RED SPOTTY",]
```

The output is the following:

```
[1] 85123A 85123a

```

As the output above shows it appears that for StockCode 85123A most of the mismatches resulted from recording some of the StockCodes as 85123a ("a" instead of "A"). This appears to be a typo, as there is nothing else in the data suggesting that StockCodes for items 85123A and 85123a should be different.

After changing StockCodes 85123a to 85123A, we are still left with mismatches between StockCode and Description fields. While Description for almost all of the items with StockCode 85123A is "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER", it appears that some of the items with this StockCode are named "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" and others have "?" in the description. Note that there is no overlap between the items that had StockCode 85123a (before we changed it to 85123A) and the items with "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" and "?" in their Description fields.

The items with "?" in the description will get dropped when we remove instances with invalid or missing descriptions.  We will not make changes to the 9 items with Description "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" as we are not sure whether the word "CREAM" instead of "WHITE" in these few purchases (all of which were made on the same date, December 8, 2011) was used intentionally or by mistake.

The mismatch between StockCode 20725 and Description amounts to one instance of "LUNCH BAG RED SPOTTY" in Description while all the other instances with this StockCode are "LUNCH BAG RED RETROSPOT".  As in the case of StockCode 85123A we will not make any changes as we are not sure whether the difference in the descriptions was made intentionally or by mistake.

Let's now move on to the other issues that we discovered by looking at the summary statistics.  As we pointed out above, there are items with negative prices.  The code below shows that there are only 2 such items. The code also shows that there are also multiple instances with price equal to zero. We remove items with negative or zero prices:

```R
items[items$UnitPrice < 0,]
items[items$UnitPrice == 0,]
items = items[items$UnitPrice > 0,]
nrow(items)
```

The code above generates the following output:

```
       InvoiceNo StockCode     Description Quantity   InvoiceDate UnitPrice CustomerID        Country       Date            DateTime Hour Minute HourMinute            ID AmountSpent

[1] 1179

[1] 530104
```

We can see that the two negative prices correspond to adjustments for bad debt.  

The 1,179 instances of zero prices should also be removed because whatever the reason for zero prices is, these instances are unlikely to contribute to finding out co-occurrence relationships among customersâ€™ purchase activities. (Further exploration of data shows that many of these 1,179 instances have missing or invalid Description fields).

The output above also shows that after the last round of cleaning the data, the number of observations was reduced from `531285` to `530104`.

As we have noted above, a number of items have missing or invalid Descriptions.  We remove these items:

```R
items[grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="[\\?\\*]"),]     # descriptions with ? or *
items = items[!grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="[\\?\\*]"),]
nrow(items)

nrow(items[grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="^$"),])   # number of empty strings
items = items[!grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="^$"),]
nrow(items)

items = subset(items, !(Description %in% c("AMAZON FEE", "Adjust bad debt", "POSTAGE", "DOTCOM POSTAGE", "Manual")))
nrow(items)
```

The number of observations declines from `530104` to `527944`.

Finally, let's remove cancellations of purchases:

```R
sum(grepl(x=items$InvoiceNo, pattern="^C.*"))       # cancelations
items = items[!grepl(x=items$InvoiceNo, pattern ="^C.*"),]
nrow(items)
```

The number of observations remains at `527944`, which means that all the cancellations were in the subset of items that we have already removed in prior rounds of data cleanining.

Let's output summary statistics again using `summary(items)`:

The summary statistics look reasonable now, except we have not addressed the issue of missing CustomerIDs yet.  This feature is important for defining a shopoing session.  Because our goal is to identify co-occurrence relationships among customersâ€™ purchase activities, it is important to define a timeframe within which such purchase activities should be counted toward co-occurence relationship.  If we were to analyze customer visits to a local supermarket, it would be pretty intuitive to define a shopping session as one trip to the supermarket.  However, when online shopping is considered, defining a shopping session is more subtle.  What if a customer has two invoices within the same day?  Should these invoices be considered as two separate shopping sessions?  What if the difference in the time stamps on these invoices is only one minute?  Maybe the only reason that we see two invoices instead of just one is because the customer made many purchases and decided to break them out into two invoices?  In that case it would be reasonable to consider the items on both invoices as part of the same shopping session.  However, if the time difference between the two invoices is 10 hours, it might rather be reasonable to consider them as separate shopping sessions (i.e., seeing items on the website during the earlier shopping session could affect purchasing behavior during that session but not during the later sessions). 

If we decide, for example, to define a shopping session for a customer as all the shopping that the customer did on the the website within one day, then a shopping session can be uniquely identified by CustomerID and InvoiceDate.  In that case availability of CustomerID is crucial.  However, if we decide to use invoices as proxies for shopping sessions, then we need only a unique invoice number (InvoiceNo) and do not need CustomerID.  

Let's understand better the difference between CustomerID and InvoiceNo. The code below outputs the number of unique values of CustomerID, InvoiceNo, and an ID variable that we defined earlier by concatenating CustomerID and Date (i.e., the date of the invoice).  

```R
length(unique(items$CustomerID))
length(unique(items$InvoiceNo[!is.na(items$CustomerID)]))
length(unique(items$ID[!is.na(items$CustomerID)]))
```

It appears that we have 4336 unique CustomerIDs, 18416 unique values for InvoiceNo (when CustomerID is not missing) and 16689 unique IDs (, also when CustomerID is not missing).  We can see that the number of unique CustomerIDs is substantially lower than the number of unique values for InvoiceNo and ID.  This could be a result of cusomters making purchases on multiple dates. Hence, a few customers can generate a large number of unique invoices as well as a large number of unique IDs (because ID is defined as a CustomerID/InvoiceDate combination).

In that case, purchases by the same customer will have the same cutomer ID but different invoice numbers.  Let's check if there are customers who made purchases on different days and plot the number of customers as a function of the number of days on which they made purchases:

```R
by_customerID = tapply(items$Date, items$CustomerID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))   # group unique dates by customer ID
temp = as.data.frame(by_customerID)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$customerID = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (customer ID) to a variable
by_no_days_customer = tapply(temp$customerID, temp$by_customerID, FUN = function(x) length(x))

barplot(by_no_days_customer, main = "Count of Customers by Number of Days\non Which They Made Purchases"
     , ylab = "Number of Customers", xlab = "Number of Days with Purchases"
     , xlim = c(0.75, 20), ylim = c(0, 1600)
     , frame.plot=FALSE, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab = .8, xaxt="n", yaxt="n", col="blue", pch = 20, type = "o")
axis(side=1, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
axis(side=2, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
box(which = "plot", bty = "l", lwd=2)
```

The bar chart generated by the code above is shown below:

**insert chart here**


The chart shows that, while many customers made purchases on one day only, a large number of customers indeed shopped on multiple days over approximatley one year period over which data are available.

InvoiceNo values are unique as reported on the official website from which the data were downloaded, and as the code below verifies by finding that there are no invoices with the same InvoiceNo issued on multiple days:

```R
length(unique(items$InvoiceNo))
by_InvoiceNo = tapply(items$Date, items$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))   # group unique dates by InvoiceNo
temp = as.data.frame(by_InvoiceNo)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$InvoiceNo = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (InvoiceNo) to a variable
by_no_days_invoice = tapply(temp$InvoiceNo, temp$by_InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(x))
```

How many invoices are there per ID (i.e., CustomerId/InvoiceDate) group? How many IDs are there with only one invoice? with 2 invoices? etc.  The code below plots the count of IDs as a function of the number of invoices issued on the same day:

```R
invoices_per_ID = with(items[!is.na(items$CustomerID),], tapply(InvoiceNo, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
hist(invoices_per_ID)
temp = as.data.frame(invoices_per_ID)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$ID = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (customer ID) to a variable
items = merge(items, temp, by = "ID", all.x = TRUE)
IDs_per_numOfInvoices = tapply(temp$ID, temp$invoices_per_ID, FUN = function(x) length(x))

barplot(IDs_per_numOfInvoices, main = "Count of IDs (CustomerID/InvoiceDate Combinations)\nby Number of Invoices Issued on the Same Day"
        , ylab = "Number of IDs", xlab = "Number of Invoices Issued on the Same Day to a Customer"
        , xlim = c(0.2, 5), ylim = c(0, 16000)
        , frame.plot=FALSE, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab = .8, xaxt="n", yaxt="n", col="blue", pch = 20, type = "o")
axis(side=1, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
axis(side=2, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
box(which = "plot", bty = "l", lwd=2)
```

The chart below shows that while majority of IDs correspond to one invoice only, a non-trivial number of IDs correspond to two or more invoices issued on the same date.

As we pointed out above, if there are large time differences between such invoices (e.g., several hours) we may consider using InvoiceNo instead of ID to identify shopping sessions.   

However, by looking at the data it appears that invoices issued to a customer on the same day tend to be stamped within minutes from each other. We check this out for the group of customers with exactly 2 invoices per day.  According to the chart above, this is the second largest group following the group with 1 invoice per day.

```R
keeps = c("ID", "InvoiceNo", "DateTime")
invoices = unique(items[items$invoices_per_ID == 2, keeps])
invoices$InvoiceNo = sequence(rle(invoices$ID)$lengths)
invoices = subset(invoices, !(ID %in% c("14194 2011-03-18", "14911 2011-05-16", "15861 2011-11-13", "17758 2011-05-15")))
invoices$DateTime = as.numeric(invoices$DateTime)
wide = reshape(invoices, idvar = "ID", timevar = "InvoiceNo", direction = "wide")
wide$Diff = abs(wide$DateTime.2 - wide$DateTime.1)/60     # convert from seconds to minutes
median(wide$Diff, na.rm = TRUE)
```

It appears that the median time difference between two invoices issued on the same date is 2 minutes.  This amount of time is too short to consider the two invoices as proxies for two separate shopping sessions.  Rather, it is possible that customers who purchase more items tend to break out their purchases into multiple invoices.  In order to test this hypothesis we comare the average number of distinct StockCodes per invoice between the group with one invoice per day and the group with multipe invoices per day.  If this hypothesis is true, then it would make sense to consider multiple invoices issued on the same day for the same customer as parts of the same shopping session. In that case, using CustomerID is preferrable to using InoiceNo. 

The code below performs a t-test to determine if this hypothesis is true:

```R
keeps = c("ID", "StockCode")
one_invoice = items[(items$invoices_per_ID == 1) & !(is.na(items$CustomerID)), keeps]
one_invoice = with(one_invoice, tapply(StockCode, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
mean(one_invoice, na.rm = TRUE)
median(one_invoice, na.rm = TRUE)

many_invoices = items[(items$invoices_per_ID > 1) & !(is.na(items$CustomerID)), keeps]
many_invoices = with(many_invoices, tapply(StockCode, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
mean(many_invoices, na.rm = TRUE)
median(many_invoices, na.rm = TRUE)

t.test(one_invoice, many_invoices)
```

The results of the t-test below show that indeed, customers who purchase more items tend to break out their purchases into multiple invoices.  The output of the t-test shows that the average numbers of distinct items in the group with one invoice per day and the group with multipe invoices per day are 22.1 adn 32.7, respectively, and the difference is statistically significant.  This suggests that the existence of multiple invoices for a customer on the same day is a result of artificially splitting one large invoice into multiple smaller invoices, which does not justify using InvoiceNo as a proxy for a shopping session.

```

This, in turn, implies that we should use CustomerID for identifying shopping sessions.  Would we have an issue if we removed the samples with missing customer IDs?  Let's compare the samples with and without customer ID.  If the samples with CustomerID are representative of the samples without CustomerID, then removing samples without CutomerID will not bias the results. However, if there are systemic differences between the two groups, then simply removing samples without CutomerID may bias the results, i.e., co-occurrence relationships among customersâ€™ purchase activities that we will identify using the samples with CustomerID are going to generate incorrect recommendations for the customers represented by the samples without CustomerID.

We first split the dataset into two groups: with CustomerID available and with CustomerID missing:

```R
with_cust_id = items[!is.na(items$CustomerID),]
no_cust_id = items[is.na(items$CustomerID),]
```

Then we calculate the number of distinct StockCodes per invoice, amount spent per invoice and hour of purchase for each group and perform a means comparison test for the two groups.  The code is shown below:

1. Calculate the number of distinct StockCodes per invoice for each group and compare the means using a t-test:

```R
dist_scode_with_id = tapply(with_cust_id$StockCode, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))
dist_scode_no_id = tapply(no_cust_id$StockCode, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))
t.test(dist_scode_with_id, dist_scode_no_id)
```

2. Calculate the amount spent per invoice for each group and compare the means using a t-test:

```R
spent_with_id = tapply(with_cust_id$AmountSpent, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = sum)
spent_no_id = tapply(no_cust_id$AmountSpent, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = sum)
t.test(spent_with_id, spent_no_id)
```

Select the time of purchase per invoice for each group (we calculate the most frequent occurance of time across items that belong to the same invoice to prevent typos affecting results, as invoice time should be the same for all items contained in it), and compare the means using a t-test:

```R
hour_with_id = tapply(
  with_cust_id$HourMinute, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo
  , FUN = function(x) {
    ux <- unique(x)
    ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
  }
)
hour_no_id = tapply(
  no_cust_id$HourMinute, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo
  , FUN = function(x) {
    ux <- unique(x)
    ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
  }
)
t.test(hour_with_id, hour_no_id)
```

The results of the above tests are summarized below:

**Table 3**

Metric of Interest  per Invoice	 | 	Mean (CustomerID is Available)	 | 	Meand (CustomerID is Missing)	 | 	Difference	 | 	t-statistic	 | 	p-value
:---	 | 	---:	 | 	---:	 | 	---:	 | 	---:	 | 	---:
Number of distinct StockCodes	 | 	20.99	 | 	95.41	 | 	-74.43	 | 	-19.93	 | 	2.20E-16
Amount spent	 | 	476.10	 | 	1100.83	 | 	-624.73	 | 	-8.81	 | 	2.20E-16
Time of purchase	 | 	13.01	 | 	14.15	 | 	-1.14	 | 	-16.27	 | 	2.20E-16



We have an issue as the samples with and w/o CustomerID are quite different. Therefore, simply removing samples with missing CustomerID from the data
may introduce bias into our analysis. However, if InvoiceNo matches CustomerID closely, then we can use InvoiceNo when customer id is missing.

what is the fraction of CustomerIDs that are missing?

```R
sum(is.na(items$CustomerID))/nrow(items)
```

we find that about 24.93% are missing

what is the fraction of IDs with multiple invoices in the sample of non-missing CustomerIDs?  We can assume that this fraction is the same
in the sample of missing CustomerIDs.  This fraction is:

```R
1-IDs_per_numOfInvoices[1]/sum(IDs_per_numOfInvoices)
```

This result means that if we were to replace CustomerID with InvoiceNo in the sample with non-missing CustomerID, we would 
misclassify 8.20% of shopping trips as different shopping session, while they, in fact, were part of other shopping sessions.

what is the fraction of IDs with multiple invoices in the entire sample?

```R
(1-IDs_per_numOfInvoices[1]/sum(IDs_per_numOfInvoices)) * (sum(is.na(items$CustomerID))/nrow(items))
```

we end up with 2.04% of the shopping sessions that occured on different days misclassified as shopping trips that occured on the same day.  
for the subsequent analysis we will prefer this small amount of misclassification over losing 25% of observations and risking bias in the analysis
if the missing observations are not representative of the rest of the data.

let's replace the missing IDs with InvoiceNo / Date combinations

```R
items$ID[is.na(items$CustomerID)] =
          paste(as.character(items$InvoiceNo[is.na(items$CustomerID)])
              , as.character(items$Date[is.na(items$CustomerID)]))   # suppliment missing IDs with (invoice no, date) combinations
```

we end up with this number of shopping sessions:

```R
length(unique(items$ID))
```
