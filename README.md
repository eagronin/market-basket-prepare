# Data Preparation

## Overview
This section summarizes the process of initial exploration and cleaning of the data from a UK-based online retailer.  The data are used in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/market-basket-prepare/) to discover co-occurrence relationships among customers’ purchase activities. Such an analysis is called market basket analysis or association analysis.  It is commonly used in marketing to increase the chance of cross-selling, provide recommendations to customers (e.g., based on their browsing history) and deliver targeted marketing (e.g., offer coupons to customers for products that are frequently purchased together with items that the customers recently bought).

The market basket analysis is discussed in the [next section](https://eagronin.github.io/market-basket-prepare/).

The analysis for this project was performed in R.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

We start by generating a few features that we will use in subsequent analysis.  These features inlude the date and time of the invoice, the total amount spent equal to the product of the item's price and quantity purchased, and an ID variable identifying all purchases by a customer on a particular day:

```R
items$Date = as.Date(items$InvoiceDate, "%m/%d/%y")               # create date variable from InvoiceDate, which also includes time
items$DateTime = strptime(items$InvoiceDate, format = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M")
items$Hour = as.numeric(substr(items$DateTime, 12, 13))           # create hour variable
items$Minute = as.numeric(substr(items$DateTime, 15, 16))         # create hour variable
items$HourMinute = items$Hour + items$Minute / 60
items$ID = paste(as.character(items$CustomerID), as.character(items$Date))   # new id variable based on (customer id, date) group
items$AmountSpent = items$Quantity * items$UnitPrice
items$InvoiceDate = NULL
```

With all the features in place, let's take a look at the summary statistics generated by the code below

```R
dim(items)                    # dimensions
summary(items)                # summary stats
apply(is.na(items), 2, sum)   # missing values
```

The summary statistics below show that the dataset has 541,909 samples and 14 features.  They also show several patterns in the data that need to be addressed further.  Specifically, 135,080 CustomerIDs are missing, which is approximately 25% of the dataset.  Further, there are items with negative quantities (returns), negative prices, in Panel A.  Futher, there are mismatches between StockCode and Description counts in Panel B, while the small magnitudes of mismatches in some instances (e.g., 2203 items for StockCode 22423 versus 2200 items for REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER) and exact matches in other instances (e.g., 2159 items for StockCode 85099B versus the same number of items for JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT) suggest that StockCode and Description counts should match.

Futher look at the data reveals that apart from the irregularities observed from the summary statistics table above, there are a number of missing or invalid descriptions, such as "?display?", "?missing", "??", "historic computer difference?....se", "POSSIBLE DAMAGES OR LOST?", etc. Also, the highest prices in the data appear against such Description fields as "AMAZON FEE", "Adjust bad debt", "POSTAGE", "DOTCOM POSTAGE", "Manual", i.e., desctiptions of various actions rather than names of items.  Finally, there are a number of cancellations that can be identified using letter "C" in the beginning of InvoiceNo.

Invalid samples should be removed from the data before we run the algorithm to determine associations between customer purchases.  We will deal with these samples first and look into how to handle missing CustomerIDs after that.

Let's check out mismatches between StockCode and Description.  Let's take a look, for example, at StockCode 22423, which has 2,203 instances versus 2,200 instances of "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER" (a difference of 3 instances).

```R
temp = items[items$StockCode == 22423,]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER",]
```

The code above generates the follwoing output:

```

```

It appears that the 3 items that result in the mismatch represent returns (negative Quantity for each) due to "damages" for two of the items and "faulty" for the third item.  Once we get rid of returned items, this mismatch then will be resolved.

The same issue appears to affect StockCode 84879 (1 mismatch as compared to the Description field):

```R
temp = items[items$StockCode == 84879,]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "ASSORTED COLOUR BIRD ORNAMENT",]
```

The code above generates the follwoing output:

```

4224 Levels:   4 PURPLE FLOCK DINNER CANDLES  50'S CHRISTMAS GIFT BAG LARGE  DOLLY GIRL BEAKER  I LOVE LONDON MINI BACKPACK  I LOVE LONDON MINI RUCKSACK  NINE DRAWER OFFICE TIDY ... ZINC WIRE SWEETHEART LETTER TRAY

```

We can see that the mismatch resulted from one damaged item that has been returned.

Let's now remove the returned items from the data.  From looking further at the data it also appears that there are a number of items with zero quantity.  Let's get rid of these observations as well:

```R
nrow(items[items$Quantity <= 0,])   
items = items[items$Quantity > 0,]
nrow(items)
```

The above code removed `10624` samples, thus reducing the total number of samples from `541909` to `531285`.

Now let's look at the remaining mismatches, i.e., StockCodes 85123A (56 mismatches) and 20725 (1 mismatch).  The code below identifies the reasons for the mismatches and resolve some of the mismatches:  

```R
temp = items[items$Description == "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER",]
unique(temp$StockCode)
items$StockCode[items$StockCode == "85123a"] = "85123A"
unique(items$Description[items$StockCode == "85123A"])
items[items$Description == "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER",]

temp = items[items$StockCode == "20725",]
unique(temp$Description)
temp[temp$Description != "LUNCH BAG RED RETROSPOT",]
items[items$Description == "LUNCH BAG RED SPOTTY",]
```

The output is the following:

```
[1] 85123A 85123a

```

As the output above shows it appears that for StockCode 85123A most of the mismatches resulted from recording some of the StockCodes as 85123a ("a" instead of "A"). This appears to be a typo, as there is nothing else in the data suggesting that StockCodes for items 85123A and 85123a should be different.

After changing StockCodes 85123a to 85123A, we are still left with mismatches between StockCode and Description fields. While Description for almost all of the items with StockCode 85123A is "WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER", it appears that some of the items with this StockCode are named "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" and others have "?" in the description. Note that there is no overlap between the items that had StockCode 85123a (before we changed it to 85123A) and the items with "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" and "?" in their Description fields.

The items with "?" in the description will get dropped when we remove instances with invalid or missing descriptions.  We will not make changes to the 9 items with Description "CREAM HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER" as we are not sure whether the word "CREAM" instead of "WHITE" in these few purchases (all of which were made on the same date, December 8, 2011) was used intentionally or by mistake.

The mismatch between StockCode 20725 and Description amounts to one instance of "LUNCH BAG RED SPOTTY" in Description while all the other instances with this StockCode are "LUNCH BAG RED RETROSPOT".  As in the case of StockCode 85123A we will not make any changes as we are not sure whether the difference in the descriptions was made intentionally or by mistake.

Let's now move on to the other issues that we discovered by looking at the summary statistics.  As we pointed out above, there are items with negative prices.  The code below shows that there are only 2 such items. The code also shows that there are also multiple instances with price equal to zero. We remove items with negative or zero prices:

```R
items[items$UnitPrice < 0,]
items[items$UnitPrice == 0,]
items = items[items$UnitPrice > 0,]
nrow(items)
```

The code above generates the following output:

```
       InvoiceNo StockCode     Description Quantity   InvoiceDate UnitPrice CustomerID        Country       Date            DateTime Hour Minute HourMinute            ID AmountSpent

[1] 1179

[1] 530104
```

We can see that the two negative prices correspond to adjustments for bad debt.  

The 1,179 instances of zero prices should also be removed because whatever the reason for zero prices is, these instances are unlikely to contribute to finding out co-occurrence relationships among customers’ purchase activities. (Further exploration of data shows that many of these 1,179 instances have missing or invalid Description fields).

The output above also shows that after the last round of cleaning the data, the number of observations was reduced from `531285` to `530104`.

As we have noted above, a number of items have missing or invalid Descriptions.  We remove these items:

```R
items[grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="[\\?\\*]"),]     # descriptions with ? or *
items = items[!grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="[\\?\\*]"),]
nrow(items)

nrow(items[grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="^$"),])   # number of empty strings
items = items[!grepl(x=items$Description, pattern="^$"),]
nrow(items)

items = subset(items, !(Description %in% c("AMAZON FEE", "Adjust bad debt", "POSTAGE", "DOTCOM POSTAGE", "Manual")))
nrow(items)
```

The number of observations declines from `530104` to `527944`.

Finally, let's remove cancellations of purchases:

```R
sum(grepl(x=items$InvoiceNo, pattern="^C.*"))       # cancelations
items = items[!grepl(x=items$InvoiceNo, pattern ="^C.*"),]
nrow(items)
```

The number of observations remains at `527944`, which means that all the cancellations were in the subset of items that we have already removed in prior rounds of data cleanining.

Let's output summary statistics again using `summary(items)`:

there is a big chunk of missing customer IDs.  Should we use invoices instead?
let's understand better the difference between these two variables:

output unique IDs

```R
length(unique(items$CustomerID))
length(unique(items$InvoiceNo))
length(unique(items$InvoiceNo[!is.na(items$CustomerID)]))
length(unique(items$ID))
```

it appears that there are substantially more invoices than customers, which is consistent with uniquness of invoice number, per definition, while 
customers could have made purchases on different days.  In that case, purchases by the same customer will have the same cutomer ID but different
invoice numbers.
are there customers who made purchases on different days?

```R
by_customerID = tapply(items$Date, items$CustomerID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))   # group unique dates by customer ID
temp = as.data.frame(by_customerID)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$customerID = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (customer ID) to a variable
by_no_days_customer = tapply(temp$customerID, temp$by_customerID, FUN = function(x) length(x))

barplot(by_no_days_customer, main = "Count of Customers by Number of Days\non Which They Made Purchases"
     , ylab = "Number of Customers", xlab = "Number of Days with Purchases"
     , xlim = c(0.75, 20), ylim = c(0, 1600)
     , frame.plot=FALSE, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab = .8, xaxt="n", yaxt="n", col="blue", pch = 20, type = "o")
axis(side=1, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
axis(side=2, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
box(which = "plot", bty = "l", lwd=2)
```

are there identical invoice numbers that appear on different days? I.e., are invoice numbers unique to each transaction?

```R
by_InvoiceNo = tapply(items$Date, items$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))   # group unique dates by InvoiceNo
temp = as.data.frame(by_InvoiceNo)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$InvoiceNo = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (InvoiceNo) to a variable
by_no_days_invoice = tapply(temp$InvoiceNo, temp$by_InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(x))
```

how many invoices are there per (customer id, date) group? How many CustomerIDs are there with only one invoice per day? with 2 invoices per day? etc.

```R
invoices_per_ID = with(items[!is.na(items$CustomerID),], tapply(InvoiceNo, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
hist(invoices_per_ID)
temp = as.data.frame(invoices_per_ID)     # convert vector to dateframe
temp$ID = rownames(temp)        # convert rownmaes (customer ID) to a variable
items = merge(items, temp, by = "ID", all.x = TRUE)
IDs_per_numOfInvoices = tapply(temp$ID, temp$invoices_per_ID, FUN = function(x) length(x))

barplot(IDs_per_numOfInvoices, main = "Count of Customers by Number of Invoices\nIssued on the Same Day"
        , ylab = "Number of Customers", xlab = "Number of Invoices Issued on the Same Day to a Customer"
        , xlim = c(0.2, 5), ylim = c(0, 16000)
        , frame.plot=FALSE, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab = .8, xaxt="n", yaxt="n", col="blue", pch = 20, type = "o")
axis(side=1, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
axis(side=2, cex.axis = 0.8, lwd=2, tck=-.005)
box(which = "plot", bty = "l", lwd=2)
```


By looking at the data it appears that invoices tend to be stamped within minutes from each other. We check this 
out for the group of customers with exactly 2 invoices per day.  According to the chart above, this is the second largest group 
after the group with 1 invoice per day.

```R
keeps = c("ID", "InvoiceNo", "DateTime")
invoices = unique(items[items$invoices_per_ID == 2, keeps])
invoices$InvoiceNo = sequence(rle(invoices$ID)$lengths)
invoices = subset(invoices, !(ID %in% c("14194 2011-03-18", "14911 2011-05-16", "15861 2011-11-13", "17758 2011-05-15")))
invoices$DateTime = as.numeric(invoices$DateTime)
wide = reshape(invoices, idvar = "ID", timevar = "InvoiceNo", direction = "wide")
wide$Diff = abs(wide$DateTime.2 - wide$DateTime.1)/60     # convert from seconds to minutes
median(wide$Diff, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Could it be that customers split their purchases into several invoices when they have too many items? 
To test this, we can comare the average number of distinct StockCodes per invoice between the group with one invoice per day and the group with 
multipe invoices per day.  If this reasoning holds, then it would make sense to consider 
multiple invoices paid on the same day for the same customer to be considered parts of the same shopping session. In that case, using customer ID
is preferrable to using InoiceNo, as InvoiceNo does not represent a separate shopping session. 
The t-test below shows that this is indeed the case, which suggests that we should use customer ID for identifying shopping sessions:

```R
keeps = c("ID", "StockCode")
one_invoice = items[(items$invoices_per_ID == 1) & !(is.na(items$CustomerID)), keeps]
one_invoice = with(one_invoice, tapply(StockCode, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
mean(one_invoice, na.rm = TRUE)
median(one_invoice, na.rm = TRUE)

many_invoices = items[(items$invoices_per_ID > 1) & !(is.na(items$CustomerID)), keeps]
many_invoices = with(many_invoices, tapply(StockCode, ID, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x))))
mean(many_invoices, na.rm = TRUE)
median(many_invoices, na.rm = TRUE)

t.test(one_invoice, many_invoices)
```

Would we have an issue if we removed the samples with missing customer IDs?  Let's compare the samples with and without 
customer ID:

split into two samples

```R
with_cust_id = items[!is.na(items$CustomerID),]
no_cust_id = items[is.na(items$CustomerID),]
```

number of distinct StockCodes per invoice

```R
dist_scode_with_id = tapply(with_cust_id$StockCode, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))
dist_scode_no_id = tapply(no_cust_id$StockCode, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = function(x) length(unique(x)))
t.test(dist_scode_with_id, dist_scode_no_id)
```

amount spent per invoice

```R
spent_with_id = tapply(with_cust_id$AmountSpent, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = sum)
spent_no_id = tapply(no_cust_id$AmountSpent, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo, FUN = sum)
t.test(spent_with_id, spent_no_id)
```

hour of purchase (use mode function to determine the most frequent occurance of hour to prevent typos affecting results, 
as an invoice hour should be the same for all items contained in it)

```R
hour_with_id = tapply(
  with_cust_id$HourMinute, with_cust_id$InvoiceNo
  , FUN = function(x) {
    ux <- unique(x)
    ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
  }
)
hour_no_id = tapply(
  no_cust_id$HourMinute, no_cust_id$InvoiceNo
  , FUN = function(x) {
    ux <- unique(x)
    ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
  }
)
t.test(hour_with_id, hour_no_id)
```


We have an issue as the samples with and w/o CustomerID are quite different. Therefore, simply removing samples with missing CustomerID from the data
may introduce bias into our analysis. However, if InvoiceNo matches CustomerID closely, then we can use InvoiceNo when customer id is missing.

what is the fraction of CustomerIDs that are missing?

```R
sum(is.na(items$CustomerID))/nrow(items)
```

we find that about 24.93% are missing

what is the fraction of IDs with multiple invoices in the sample of non-missing CustomerIDs?  We can assume that this fraction is the same
in the sample of missing CustomerIDs.  This fraction is:

```R
1-IDs_per_numOfInvoices[1]/sum(IDs_per_numOfInvoices)
```

This result means that if we were to replace CustomerID with InvoiceNo in the sample with non-missing CustomerID, we would 
misclassify 8.20% of shopping trips as different shopping session, while they, in fact, were part of other shopping sessions.

what is the fraction of IDs with multiple invoices in the entire sample?

```R
(1-IDs_per_numOfInvoices[1]/sum(IDs_per_numOfInvoices)) * (sum(is.na(items$CustomerID))/nrow(items))
```

we end up with 2.04% of the shopping sessions that occured on different days misclassified as shopping trips that occured on the same day.  
for the subsequent analysis we will prefer this small amount of misclassification over losing 25% of observations and risking bias in the analysis
if the missing observations are not representative of the rest of the data.

let's replace the missing IDs with InvoiceNo / Date combinations

```R
items$ID[is.na(items$CustomerID)] =
          paste(as.character(items$InvoiceNo[is.na(items$CustomerID)])
              , as.character(items$Date[is.na(items$CustomerID)]))   # suppliment missing IDs with (invoice no, date) combinations
```

we end up with this number of shopping sessions:

```R
length(unique(items$ID))
```
